Here’s a more *human-friendly*, easy-to-understand version of the summary:

Project Summary (Humanized Version)

This project is all about building a smart system that can look at past data and predict what will happen in the future—kind of like forecasting weather, sales, stock prices, or energy usage.

What You Need to Do

Get a Time-Series Dataset

* You need data that changes over time (like daily sales or monthly temperatures).
* It should have at least 1000 data points.
* You can either download real data or even create your own with some patterns like trends or seasonal changes.

Build a Deep Learning Forecasting Model

* You’ll be using advanced models like LSTM or Transformers that can learn from sequences.
* Before training, you’ll prepare the data (scale it, split it into windows, etc.).
* Then you’ll tune the model to get the best performance.

Test How Good the Model Is

* You’ll check its accuracy using at least three different metrics.
* You must also compare it with a simpler traditional model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing to see if deep learning actually performs better.

Understand the Model’s Decisions

* Use tools like SHAP or attention plots to explain why the model made certain predictions.
* This helps show which parts of the data influenced the forecast the most.



What You Need to Submit

Python Code

* Complete code that generates/loads data, trains the model, tests it, and explains the results.

A Written Report

* Describe the dataset, the model you built, how you tuned it, and how it compares to the traditional model.

Interpretation Findings

* Explain what you learned from SHAP or attention—basically, what the model is paying attention to.

Final Summary

 Wrap up the results and say whether this model is good enough to be used in real-world deployment.
